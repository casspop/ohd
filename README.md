Garage Door Monitor (OverHeadDoor) - Python3, Raspbian learning project

This is my very first GitHub project.  It is a re-write of my very first Python program, a garage door monitor to 
run on a Raspberry Pi.  I'm learning Python, and I'm learning Git and trying to wrap my head around a bunch of new stuff.
This is that first step.
