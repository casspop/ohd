Garage Door Monitor (OverHeadDoor) - Python3, Raspbian learning project

02/06/2019 UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This is my very first GitHub project.  It is a re-write of my very first Python program, a garage door monitor to 
run on a Raspberry Pi.  I'm learning Python, and I'm learning Git and trying to wrap my head around a bunch of new stuff.
This is that first step.

I created a branch in which to work (the Guide told me to do it).
