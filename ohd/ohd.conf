## NotifyNumber - How many email addresses to use in notifications.  Notifications are outbound
#           emails or SMS texts sent to inform specified individuals about status changes.
#
NotifyNumber: 2
#
## NotifyEmail# - assign each address to one NotifyEmail line.  The number at the end of the string
## 			will be checked, and only those less than or equal to the number in 
##			NotifyNumber (above) will be used.   
##			Keep these NotifyEmail# lines in numerical order.  No gaps in numbers.  You may have more
##          lines here than you need, but you need at least as many as the NotifyNumber above.
#
NotifyEmail1: EmailToNotify@whatever.com
NotifyEmail2: EmailToNotify@something.com
# NotifyEmail3: 
# NotifyEmail4: 
# NotifyEmail5: 
#
## NotifyBPLimit - If the bypass switch has been pressed (it's ON) and it's past this hour of the day,

## CmdEmNum - How many email addresses are authorized to issue commands.  You can have more InBoundEmail addresses configured
##            but we're only going to check however many are specified here.

#
CmdEmNum: 3
#
##
## InBoundEmail# - Email addresses authorized to issue commands to the program

InBoundEmail1:authorizedEmail_1@hotmail.com

## The following two lines define the email address/pass combo for this ohd hardware.  I created a gMail account 
## for the Raspberry Pi that ohd runs on. This is the 
## way this door monitor can send and receive messages.  The way I set things up is Gmail-only, so the address has to be 
## a @gmail.com address.  ALSO NOTE THIS: the password is held here in plaintext.  There is potential for
## abuse.  Don't use this in any environment where high security is a requirement.
## IT IS NOT SECURE.  However, a person has to have physical possession of the Pi, (or the SSH login).  I use it anyway.
